# d8_doctrine
Example drupal 8 module using doctrine.

This module was developed as using doctrine as an alternative database library for working with 
ERP data in databases other than drupal. I was trying to see if I could develop unit test cases 
against doctrine data structures that were created on the fly using in memory sqllite database.  

To perfrom proper ERP testing, it would be desireable to augment this coverage with BeHAT testing 
to cover behavioral tests against a a development drupal site.
